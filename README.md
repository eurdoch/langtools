# langtools

This is a collection of tools that utilizes Anthropic language models to use online content to learn foreign languages.  Currently the suite of tools contains:

- Langpub: An epub reader
- Web-extension: A Google Chrome extension

(Currently working on iOS/Android extension)

The tools are open sourced and can be used by either setting up independently or by subscribing to a managed service.  If you'd like to set them up yourself, it requires an AWS account.  Skip to DIY section for a guide.
